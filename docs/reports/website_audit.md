## Layout & Responsiveness

### Issues Found
- **[MAJOR]** Missing viewport meta tag in layout.tsx - critical for mobile responsiveness
- **[MINOR]** Full-page screenshot timeout suggests potential performance issues with complex animations
- **[MINOR]** Navigation menu could benefit from improved mobile UX patterns

### Recommendations
- Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />` to layout.tsx
- Implement CSS Grid with `grid-template-areas` for main layout sections
- Add responsive breakpoint testing for 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px viewports
- Consider implementing CSS Container Queries for component-level responsiveness

## Accessibility Compliance

### Issues Found
- **[CRITICAL]** Missing alt text verification for founder image and project screenshots
- **[MAJOR]** Form validation errors may not be properly announced to screen readers
- **[MINOR]** Focus indicators could be more prominent for keyboard navigation
- **[MINOR]** Skip navigation link missing for keyboard users

### Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive alt text for all images with descriptive, contextual content
- Add `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` attributes to form fields with proper error announcements
- Enhance focus indicators with 3px outline and high contrast colors
- Add skip navigation link: `<a href="#main" class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to main content</a>`
- Conduct screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver

## Performance Analysis

### Issues Found
- **[CRITICAL]** Next.js config allows all remote images (`hostname: '**'`) - major security and performance risk
- **[MAJOR]** External Unsplash images loaded without Next.js Image optimization
- **[MAJOR]** No image format optimization (WebP/AVIF) implementation
- **[MINOR]** Complex animations may impact Core Web Vitals on lower-end devices

### Recommendations
- Restrict image domains to specific trusted sources in next.config.ts
- Implement Next.js Image component with proper sizing and format optimization
- Add WebP/AVIF format support with fallbacks
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Add performance budgets: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Use React.memo() for expensive components and useMemo() for heavy calculations

## User Experience & Usability

### Issues Found
- **[MAJOR]** Contact form requires 30+ characters minimum - may frustrate users with simple inquiries
- **[MINOR]** No loading states or progress indicators for form submission
- **[MINOR]** Missing breadcrumb navigation for deep content sections
- **[MINOR]** No search functionality for projects/content

### Recommendations
- Reduce minimum character requirement to 10-15 characters for contact form
- Implement loading spinners and success/error toast notifications using Sonner
- Add breadcrumb navigation component for improved wayfinding
- Consider implementing search functionality with Algolia or similar service
- Add "Back to top" button for long-form content sections

## Code Quality & Architecture

- Implement Content Security Policy headers in next.config.ts
- Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Implement error boundaries with user-friendly fallback UI
- Add comprehensive ESLint rules for code quality enforcement

## Industry Standards Alignment
